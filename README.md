# Receiver-2-ShockTape

Ever felt that stock tape hunting is too boring for you? That it lacked the trill? Well, here's a mod just for you!

## Watch what you pick up!

The threat has found a new way to hunt receivers, turning their favourite tool against them! Post mindkill environment is now littered with rigged tapes that blind receivers and alert nearby drones.

## To shoot or not to shoot?

Shock tape's contents are fragile and can be easily destroyed by shooting it. But ammunition is getting scarce around here, so is it really worth it to shoot every tape you find? Or try to distinguish between the tapes based on a slight color change, difficult to notice in the heat of battle? The choice is yours!

## *Technical Info*

### Installation

Simply copy the __ShockTape__ folder to BepInEx/plugins in your Receiver 2 game directory.

If you don't have BepInEx, you can download it from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)

### Configuration

This plugin uses BepInEx configuration files, with two configs:

 - #### Enabled
      Whether or not the plugin should replace stock tapes with modded ones
 - #### Flashbang tape chance
      Chance of spawning a modded tape instead of a stock one, replaces all tapes at 1 and no tapes at 0
 - #### Difficulty
      **Easy** paints booby-trapped tapes in distinct colors, making it easier to spot them
      **Hard** makes the them barely distinguishable from regular tapes. Hope you brought a flashlight!
